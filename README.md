This is the repository for my personal/professional website. [Link.](https://jonathanalcaraz.github.io)

## ToDo

+ Fix GH link in footer
+ Adjust font-sizes to *all* use `rem`.
+ Fix email on home page
+ Restructure layout to make CSS simpler.
  - This is vague, but I just feel that main.css is more complicated than it needs to be. My goal is to get to a point where I can make a simple webpage without touching any CSS and create separate style sheets for more complicated pages (see [this page](https://JonathanAlcaraz.github.io/teaching/topqualprep20) with [this style sheet](/assets/main.css)).
+ Add Dark Mode switch
