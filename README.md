## ToDo

+ Fix GH link in footer
+ Adjust font-sizes to *all* use `rem`.
+ Restructure layout to make CSS simpler.
  - This is vague, but I just feel that main.css is more complicated than it needs to be. My goal is to get to a point where I can make a simple webpage without touching any CSS and create separate style sheets for more complicated pages (see [this page](/teaching/topqualprep) with [this style sheet](/assets/main.css)).
